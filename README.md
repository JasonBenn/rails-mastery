## Rails Mastery

The best way to learn a tool is to build lots of projects with that tool. But when you build 5 apps, are you getting 5 apps worth of experience, or are you getting 1 app worth of experience 5 times?

One way to measure mastery of a tool is how well you are familiar with the total API surface area of your tool. To help inspire a variety of projects and accelerate your progress towards stack mastery, this project will show you your progress towards utilizing your entire tool's API surface area. This is especially great for beginners who don't know what to build next! Currently, only Rails is supported. 

Add all of your Rails repos and see how much you really know about Rails!

## Contributing

Help building a list of must-know features for any tool would be greatly appreciated! Especially, at the start, for Rails, Node.js, Ember.js, and anything else.

## Under the hood

This app uses parsing expression grammars (PEGs) using the [Treetop DSL](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/) to identify which features have been used in a Rails-shaped repo. A PEG is essentially a fancy regex. Treetop's site provides a fantastic introduction to custom parsers, check it out, especially if you like to drop fancy buzzwords.
